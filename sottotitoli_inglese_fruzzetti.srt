1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,330
THE WEB CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES ALSO CALLED WCAG

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,730
THE CRITERION THAT WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK TODAY IS WHAT I HAVE CHOSEN

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,960
SUCCESS CRITERION 2.4.6 TALKING ABOUT HEADERS AND LABELS

4
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,160
WE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE LINK THAT TAKES US TO THE OFFICIAL PAGE

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,000
BUT WE START THE HEADERS RIGHT AWAY

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,760
H1 H2 H3 HEADERS TO H6

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,130
THEIR GREATEST DIFFERENCE IS THE SIZE OF THE WORD

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,600
WHICH IS INSIDE THESE HEADERS IN FACT

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,760
WE CAN SEE IN THE PHOTO BELOW THE TEXT

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,960
THE INSCRIPTION IN THE HEADER

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
H1 WILL BE MUCH BIGGER

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
COMPARED TO THE H6

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
WHEREAS H3,H4,H5 ARE QUANTITIES

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,960
WHICH ARE IN THE MIDDLE H1 AND H6

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,030
WHICH ARE USED FOR THE TEXT

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,630
WHILE H1 IS USUALLY USED

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,260
FOR A TITLE IT IS A PART WHICH MUST BE VERY VISIBLE

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,260
TO THE USER VISITING THE SITE

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,930
H STANDS FOR HEADING I MEAN THE HEAD

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,500
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADERS

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,730
IN FACT, THERE ARE PARAGRAPHS HEADERS

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,360
WHICH ARE CALLED P WHICH IN FACT P STANDS FOR PARAGRAPH

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,330
THAT LATER WE WILL SEE WHAT CHANGES FROM H1 H2 AND P

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:01,530
PARAGRAPH IS THE BASIC UNIT WHICH SUBDIVIDES A TEXT

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,530
ALSO CALLED TAG

26
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,660
WHAT DOES THE PARAGRAPH DO?

27
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,660
LEAVE AN EMPTY LINE BEFORE OPENING

28
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,300
AND AFTER ITS CLOSURE

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,530
THEN TITLES ARE VERY IMPORTANT

30
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:31,300
IN FACT, PEOPLE WITH DISABLES OR SHORT MEMORY

31
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,230
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE CLEAR TITLES

32
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,560
TO GET YOU BACK TO THE POINT

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,930
INITIAL OR WHERE THEY WERE LOST

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,930
OR A KEYWORD I MEAN

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,160
A WORD THAT REMINDS ME OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING

36
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,000
TITLES HAVE MORE THAN THIS PURPOSE

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,000
BUT THEY ARE ALSO INTENDED FOR READING

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,390
OR MAKE PEOPLE SURF THE SITE MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY

39
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,930
BECAUSE HAVING VERY CLEAR AND DEFINED TITLES

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,960
WE ALSO HAVE A VERY CLEAR AND CLEAN SITE

41
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,630
LET’S GO AND SEE THE HEADERS RIGHT AWAY

42
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,860
WE BEGIN TO OPEN A REAL WEBSITE

43
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,500
YOU NEED THE HEAD INSIDE

44
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,000
WE FIND THE TITLE, THE TITLE TAG

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,730
THE TITLE AS MENTIONED ABOVE IS VERY IMPORTANT

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,300
BUT THIS IS THE TITLE OF THE PAGE WE PUT IN THIS CASE

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:14,390
WCAG... BELOW WE MUST OPEN

48
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,030
LIKE EVERY SITE THE BODY

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,930
THE BODY OF THE WEBSITE WE ARE GOING TO CREATE

50
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,330
NOW LET’S TRY THE HEADERS NOW... THE MAIN ONES

51
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,370
IN FACT IF WE GO TO WRITE IN A HEADER

52
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,500
H1 LET’S CALL IT "TEST TEXT"

53
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,100
AND LET’S GO GET AN H6 HEADER

54
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:57,500
AND WE WRITE THE USUAL TEXT WE CAN GO AND SEE

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,200
THAT H1 AS WE SAID IS MUCH BIGGER

56
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,160
COMPARED TO H6

57
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,030
H1 MAY BE USED AS A HEADLINE WHILE H6

58
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,680
A TITLE WITH THESE MAGNITUDES IS NOT VERY GOOD
